I'm a third-year Ph.D. Candidate from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), Shanghai, P.R.C. My research interests and engineering experience include digital VLSI design, software and hardware co-design for high-performance computation (privacy-preserving computation and AI computation), and SoC design for embedded systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fan Yang](https://ephonic.github.io/) of CAD Lab from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Hubei, P.R.C. in 2022.
