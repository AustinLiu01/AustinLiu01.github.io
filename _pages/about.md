I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), Shanghai, P.R.C. My research interests lie in algorithm–hardware co-design for accelerating large language models (LLMs), inference acceleration techniques, and AI chip design. Previously, my work focused on acceleration methods for privacy-preserving computation and integrated circuit design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fan Yang](https://ephonic.github.io/) of CAD Lab from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Hubei, P.R.C. in 2022. You can visit my [Google Scholar homepage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M0BekPkAAAAJ&hl=en).

From June to November in 2025, I was a Project Up (青云计划) intern at Technology Engineering Group, Tencent, where I work on AI hardware acceleration solutions. My responsibilities include, but are not limited to, investigating and analyzing AI chip architectures and implementation methods both domestically and internationally, as well as optimizing the inference performance of in-house AI models. Previously, I was a research intern at Ant Research, Ant Group, where I focused on homomorphic encryption algorithms and conducted related research on algorithm–hardware co-design for homomorphic encryption.
