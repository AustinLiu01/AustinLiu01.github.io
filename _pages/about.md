I'm a second-year Ph.D. student from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), Shanghai, P.R.C. My research interests include VLSI design and software and hardware co-design for privacy-preserving computation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fan Yang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/64/c31157a352356/page.htm) of CAD Lab from [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Hubei, P.R.C. in 2022.
