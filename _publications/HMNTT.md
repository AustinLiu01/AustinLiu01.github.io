Abstract: In privacy-preserving applications like Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), polynomial multiplication is common, and the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a key algorithm for reducing its complexity. In this paper, we present HMNTT, a highly efficient MDC-NTT architecture. Utilizing the four-step NTT algorithm and a pipelined transpose module, HMNTT offers a highly efficient and scalable architecture for handling NTT with large degrees. We optimize the processing element (PE) to alleviate backpressure and data conflicts in data flow. Leveraging FPGA characteristics, we construct a modular multiplication module to reduce resource usage and improve operating frequency. Evaluation results indicate that HMNTT achieves an average of 2.34× and 1.26× reduction in Area-Time Product compared to the latest pipelined NTT architectures.
