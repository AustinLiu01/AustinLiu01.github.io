**Abstract**: Recently, there has been increased emphasis on
privacy-preserving computation technologies such as homomorphic encryption (HE) and Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). Modular
multiplication is a critical component for both HE and ZKP.
Variable bit-width is a must for many applications of privacypreserving computation, due to variable bit-width requirements
for different cryptography schemes. However, the majority of
modular multipliers that support variable bit-width configurations exhibit relatively low throughput. This work presents a
fully pipelined Montgomery modular multiplier with variable bitwidth support. Truncated multipliers are introduced to reduce
the resources of modular multipliers in our approach. In order
to meet different bit-width requirements, the proposed modular
multiplier can be dynamically reconfigured. The proposed design
can support widely used bit-width configurations, specifically,
384-bit, 256-bit, and 128-bit. 256-bit and 128-bit modes support
parallel computation of 2 and 6 sets of operands, respectively.
Compared with existing variable bit-width modular multipliers,
the proposed reconfigurable modular multiplier significantly
improves the throughputs with even lower resources.
